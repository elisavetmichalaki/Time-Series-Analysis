# Time-Series-Analysis
MSc Project in Time Series Analysis

The primary objective is to analyze temporal data, detect underlying patterns such as seasonality, trend, and correlation, and evaluate the performance of various predictive models across different forecasting horizons.

The workflow consists of four main stages:
- Exploratory Time Series Analysis (EDA)
- Baseline Modeling with Autoregression (AR)
- Neural Network Models for Sequence Prediction
- Model Evaluation and Comparison
